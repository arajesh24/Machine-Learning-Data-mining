# Machine Learning and Data Mining (MLDM) Project

## Project Overview
This project analyzes multiple machine learning
algorithms on two datasets: a weather dataset predicting if
it will rain tomorrow and a diabetes dataset predicting
diabetes. 
1. **Weather Prediction**: Predicting whether it will rain tomorrow using the [Rain in Australia dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package).
2. **Diabetes Prediction**: Predicting the presence of diabetes using the [Pima Indians Diabetes Database](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database).

The models developed include:
- **Decision Tree**
- **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**

## Key Findings
- **MLP** achieved the highest accuracy for the weather dataset.
- **Decision Tree** was optimized using pruning to prevent overfitting.

## Setup Instructions
### 1. Download the Repository
- Click the "Download" button on the repository page.
- Select **Download ZIP**.
- Extract the downloaded ZIP file to your desired location.

### 2. Running the Project
1. Open your terminal.
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. In the Jupyter interface, navigate to the project directory.
4. Open and run the notebook files.

### 3. Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues:
- Verify that **Jupyter Notebook** is installed properly.
- Ensure you're in the correct directory when launching Jupyter.
- Check that all required dependencies are installed.
- Modify file paths in the notebook if necessary.
