# Machine Learning and Data Mining (MLDM) Project

## Project Overview
Data preprocessing, Decision Tree, and MLP models were developed for weather and diabetes prediction using Python, scikit-learn, pandas, and Jupyter Notebook. Feature engineering, pruning, and hyperparameter tuning were applied to optimize accuracy. The datasets were sourced from Kaggle, and models were evaluated using classification metrics and cross-validation techniques.s:
1. **Weather Prediction**: Predicting whether it will rain tomorrow using the [Rain in Australia dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package).
2. **Diabetes Prediction**: Predicting the presence of diabetes using the [Pima Indians Diabetes Database](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database).

The models developed include:
- **Decision Tree**
- **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**

## Key Findings
- **MLP** achieved the highest accuracy for the weather dataset.
- **Decision Tree** was optimized using pruning to prevent overfitting.

## Setup Instructions
### 1. Download the Repository
- Click the "Download" button on the repository page.
- Select **Download ZIP**.
- Extract the downloaded ZIP file to your desired location.

### 2. Running the Project
1. Open your terminal.
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
